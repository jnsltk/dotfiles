# .files

Configuration files for my current GNU/Linux desktop (on an Acer notebook). I'm not a professional programmer and everything considering Linux and (especially) scripting on here is just for my personal use, on which I constantly try to improve. If anything, use this as an inspiration and pick ideas you like, to research and integrate them on your own system.
