## Conky

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/conky

Belongs in your home directory `~/`.

I tend to use conky together with tint2 as taskbar to show if a VPN is active, CPU%, MEM%, core temperature, connected wifi SSID, wifi download rate, wifi upload rate, MPD and mopidy, weather (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=37381), date and time.

Used font is tewi (https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font). Icons are supported tewi glyphs.
