## Conky

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/conky

I tend to use conky together with tint2 as taskbar to show CPU%, MEM%, core temperature, connected wifi network, wifi download rate, wifi upload rate, weather (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=37381), date and time. It's really primitive.

Used font is Tewi: https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font. Icons are supported tewi glyphs.
